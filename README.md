# ♻️ Smart Waste Management Performance Report

A comprehensive Power BI solution for waste management analytics and performance optimization.

## Project Overview

This dashboard provides actionable insights for waste management operations across multiple facilities. It helps stakeholders monitor key metrics, identify inefficiencies, and implement data-driven improvements.

The project includes a custom Python script for generating realistic mock data and a fully interactive Power BI dashboard with multiple views tailored to different stakeholder needs.

## Dashboard Features

### Key Insights View

The executive summary provides at-a-glance performance metrics:

- Current recycling rate (48%) relative to target (50%)
- Cost per ton ($152.23) with variance analysis
- Bin fill efficiency (80%)
- Carbon reduction achievement (368 tons)

Problem areas requiring attention:
- Vancouver & Toronto locations (59 tons each)
- Rising April costs (+12% from February)
- Underperforming paper recycling (32% vs 40% target)

Prioritized action items derived from the data:
1. Calgary cost reduction initiative
2. Edmonton waste practice enhancements
3. April operational review
4. Route optimization for SmartWaste Co.

### Main Dashboard

The operational dashboard visualizes:

- Total waste volume (211 tons) with location breakdown
- Average cost per ton ($152.23) 
- Recycling performance (48%)
- Bin fill level monitoring (80% average)
- Vendor performance metrics
- Cost breakdown over time
- Carbon reduction distribution (368 tons)
- Recycling composition analysis

## Technical Components

### Data Architecture

The solution consists of:

- **Mock Data Generation**: Custom Python script creating realistic waste management data
- **Dataset Integration**: Five integrated datasets covering waste collection, costs, recycling, vendor performance, and sustainability metrics
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Interactive visualization with filters, drill-down capabilities, and conditional formatting

### Key Datasets

The dashboard is powered by five core datasets:

1. **Waste Collection Summary**: Tracks volumes, bin fill percentages, and pickup frequency
2. **Cost Optimization Tracker**: Monitors service costs, penalties, and cost efficiency
3. **Recycling Performance**: Measures recycling rates against goals by material type
4. **Vendor Scorecard**: Evaluates vendor service quality metrics
5. **Sustainability KPIs**: Tracks environmental impact and waste diversion
